Role Testing
------------

This repository comes with Molecule tests for Docker on the supported platforms.
Install Molecule by running
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the tests with
```bash
molecule test
```

These tests are automatically ran by GitHub Actions on push. If the tests are successful, the role is automatically published to Ansible Galaxy.

GitHub Actions is supposed to fail for this template repository, as it does not contain any meaningful role. There is an explicit assertion to check if the role name has been changed from `template` which causes the test to fail.    

Role Structure
--------------

Roles have an entrypoint `main.yml` which includes other files.  
It searches for files in `vars/`, `tasks/assert/` and `tasks/setup` for files named like the host platform. If no file is found, it falls back to `default.yml`.  

This is an easy way to provide distro-specific variables, assertions and tasks and allows me to keep the role structure clean.  

Using Template
--------------
To use this template for a new role, run
```bash
export NEW_ROLE_NAME="NEW_NAME"
export GITHUB_USER="diademiemi"
export GALAXY_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/diademiemi/${GITHUB_USER}/g" {} + # Do not run this more than once
find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/template/${NEW_ROLE_NAME}/g" {} + # Do not run this more than once

# Assumes repo is named ansible_role_${NEW_ROLE_NAME}
gh secret set GALAXY_API_KEY -R ${GITHUB_USER}/ansible_role_${NEW_ROLE_NAME} -a actions -b ${GALAXY_API_KEY}

# Remove this section from README.md
sed -i "/Role Structure/Q" README.md
```

This is also provided as a script as `replace.sh`.
